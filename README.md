#pong

A game made using Love2D Library for Lua.

##Inspiration

In tenth grade, I created a clone of the popular game Pong in Java.
This is an attempted recreation, as practice and my first foray into lua/Love2D programming.

##Requirements
Requires Love2D installed (for now).
Downloadable from: http://http://love2d.org
